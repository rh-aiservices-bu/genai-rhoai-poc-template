# AnythingLLM

[AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/) is the "All-in-one AI application. Any LLM, any document, any agent, fully private."

## Image

The Containerfile can be used to build a container image fully compatible with OpenShift. This image can be used:

- As a custom Workbench in OpenShift AI.
- As a standalone container on OpenShift (the application will listen on port 8888).
- As a local standalone container (for example using Podman).

Prebuilt images are available at [https://quay.io/repository/rh-aiservices-bu/anythingllm-workbench](https://quay.io/repository/rh-aiservices-bu/anythingllm-workbench).
